## What is UX Design?

UX (User Experience) Design is a set of processes, techniques, methods, and methodologies used to develop products, whether digital or physical. The goal is to create meaningful, relevant, and enjoyable experiences for users.

At every moment of our lives, we experience reactions and emotions, and it's precisely at that point where a UX designer comes into play. Their role is to design and manage each of the interactions that users have with our products. The UX designer strives to understand the needs and behaviors of users to provide them with a satisfying and pleasant experience in their interaction with the product.

The world of experience design is not as straightforward as it seems since the ones reacting and experiencing emotions are people, human beings. It's precisely there where everything becomes complicated; human beings are a complex species with motivations, feelings, environments, behavioral patterns, and a series of complexities that shape us.

To gain a solid understanding of these concepts, I invite you to carefully explore the list available at [![Index](https://img.shields.io/badge/index-yellow)](english/index.md). Keep in mind that this information is just a starting point, so it's crucial to continue researching to acquire a deeper and applicable knowledge in various situations.
